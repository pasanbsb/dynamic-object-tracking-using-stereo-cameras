# calibrate-stereo-cameras
This program use stereo cameras to calculate 3D information of a scene. The stereo cameras should be fully calibrated to obtain the parameters that allow calculating 3D information of a scene. 
The problem of camera calibration is to compute the camera extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. The extrinsic parameters of a camera indicate the position and the orientation of the camera with respect to the coordinate system, and the intrinsic parameters characterize the inherent properties of the camera optics, including the focal length, the image center, the image scaling factor and the lens distortion coefficients. The number of parameters to be evaluated depends on the camera model being utilized.
